# PrivateFolder
A Folder / File encryption tool to encrypt your private files and folders!
## Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
## Installation
Afer you're done installing Java 1.8 (https://www.java.com/de/download/) you can just double click the file!
## Usage
After you selected what you want to encrypt (File / Folder) you can just type in your path, press the choose button or drag and drop your file onto the path field. For the key you can type in your own (bare in mind, that only 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 are valid key lengths) key, click the random button (unsafe, read the Warning paragraph), which will generate a 256 char long key or drag and drop a file containing the key onto the key field. After that you can press the encrypt or decrypt button.
## Warning
The random key generation is not cryprographically secure and can easily be intercepted by maleware or even hardware hacking like power analysis.

I don't care what you do with this programm / source code as long as you credit me!
